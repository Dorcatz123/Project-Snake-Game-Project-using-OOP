#Import modules: turtle module is the main one as this will mimic our snake:

from turtle import Screen
from snake import Snake
import time
from food import Food
from score import Score

#This will let the screen listen to you:
screen.listen()

screen.title("SnakeGame!!")

#Calling the snake,food and score board class:

snake = Snake()
food = Food()
score_board = Score()
game_is_on = True

#This will make the snake move according to your commands:

screen.onkeypress(key="a", fun=snake.turn_left)
screen.onkeypress(key="d", fun=snake.turn_right)
screen.onkeypress(key="s", fun=snake.turn_down)
screen.onkeypress(key="w", fun=snake.turn_up)



while game_is_on:
    screen.update()
#modify the argument in time.sleep() to increase the speed of the snake:
    # warning: 0.01 will make it too fast! so try from 0.09 and down...
    time.sleep(0.09)
    snake.move()
